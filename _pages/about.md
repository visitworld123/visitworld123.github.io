I am a first-year PhD student at [AIM Group](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/index.htm) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by [Prof. Yixuan Yuan](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/people/people.htm). I'm also working closely with [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/) and [Dr.Yonggang Zhang](https://yonggangzhangben.github.io/index.html) at the [TMLR group](https://github.com/tmlr-group), HKBU . 
Prior to this, I earned my M.S. degree from Beihang University (BUAA), advised by Prof. [Prof. Hao Peng](https://penghao-bdsc.github.io/). I also completed my B.S. degree at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST), where I spent four enriching years.
My research focuses on Federated Learning and its applications, particularly in privacy-preserving healthcare solutions.

Beyond academia, I am an avid basketball enthusiast and a devoted fan of Kobe Bryant. I enjoy immersing myself in live music, especially hip-hop and R&B, with Nous Underground from XAC being a favorite. Additionally, I have a deep interest in Chinese history, particularly the Ming Dynasty.
